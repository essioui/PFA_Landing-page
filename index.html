        <h1>About This Project</h1>

        <blockquote class="about-quote">
            When I graduated, I couldn't find work in my field, 
            so I took on various jobs and eventually worked as a waiter 
            in a hotel. From this experience, I got the idea to create a project 
            that would help both waiters and customers by making services faster 
            and easier. I hope this project will benefit everyone because my goal 
            in life is to help others and make them happy. I want to ensure that 
            technology serves us in meaningful and helpful ways.
        </blockquote>

        <p class="about-text">
            Holberton School has guided me in transforming my ideas into projects. 
            Through its curriculum, I've learned how to take my thoughts and turn 
            them into structured, practical projects that can make an impact. 
            This experience has empowered me to bring my concepts to life and work 
            toward meaningful goals.
